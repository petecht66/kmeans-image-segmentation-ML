# kmeans-image-segmentation-ML
Date Assigned: October 14, 2025 Date Submitted: October 26, 2025

This project was an assignment for CISC484: Intro to Machine Learning, which is being taught in the Fall of 2025 at the University of Delaware by Professor Xu Yuan. This class is an undergraduate course within the Computer and Information Sciences department at the University of Delaware College of Engineering. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the key concepts and techniques of machine learning.

This specific project involves image segmentation using both the K-means function in scikit-learn and a manual implementation from scratch. The remade images for these two methods can be found within this repository. 

For this project, Professor Yuan provided four images but did not upload any demo code for students. It was up to students to create notebooks in Jupyter Notebook for each of the two methods and perform the same image segmentation task.

To modify this code and project, Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook were accessed through Anaconda Navigator. After submission, this project was uploaded to GitHub.
